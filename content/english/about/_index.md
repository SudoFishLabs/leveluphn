LevelUp for Hackernews is created by Hemant Chaudhary, an independent app developer and founder of the app studio, Sudofish Labs ([sudofish.com](https://sudofish.com)). Born out of Hemant's own use of Hacker News â€“ often finding himself wanting to grasp the key points of an article and jump straight to the comments :)

This app marks the first release from Sudofish Labs. Follow [@sudofishlabs](https://x.com/sudofishlabs) on X to see what's next!
