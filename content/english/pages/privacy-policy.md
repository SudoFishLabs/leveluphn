We collect information in the following ways:

*   **Information You Provide Directly:**

This allows you to upvote and comment on stories within the App. This feature is entirely optional.
    *   **Google/Apple Login (Optional):** If you choose to log in with Google (on Android) or Google/Apple (on iOS), we collect your name and email address. This is used to provide you with AI-generated summaries and to track your usage of the free and paid summary quota. This feature is entirely optional.
    *   **In-App Purchases:** When you purchase additional AI summaries, your payment information is processed securely by Google (on Android) or Apple (on iOS). We *do not* store your payment card details or other sensitive financial information.

        *   Usage data (e.g., summary generated event)
        *   Performance metrics (e.g., app launch time)
        
    *This data is *not* personally identifiable, is *not* associated with any user ID, and is *not* used to track you individually. It is used for aggregate analytics and debugging purposes only.* This information is not shared with any other parties.

    *   We *do not* collect your mobile device ID.
    *   We *do not* collect your location data.

*   **Service Providers:**
    *   **Firebase:** We use Firebase (a Google service) for analytics, as described above.
    *   **Apple/Google:** We use Apple and Google for in-app purchase processing. Their respective privacy policies (linked above) govern their handling of payment information.
*   **Legal Requirements:** We may disclose information if required to do so by law, legal process, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Hemant Chaudhary, our users, or others. This includes responding to lawful requests from government authorities.

**4. Data Security**
